to create local repo , use git init
by default when we create fole it will be a part of working directory,
we need to let git know that this is a part of git and it goes to staging area

git status - shows file on branch or untracked files

to delete .git, use rm .git or go to folder and delete .git folder

to set bracnh to main instead of master , 
use git init -b main (here -b stands for branch)

if we want to add a file to staging area, we need to
use git add <filename>
